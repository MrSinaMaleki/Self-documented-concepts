## Django REST Framework

**Main Topics**
1. Serialization
2. Requests and responses
3. Class Based views
4. Authentication and permissions
5. Relationships and hyperlinked APIs
6. Viewsets and router
7. Generic Views


**Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.**

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:
* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
* Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.

**Requirements**

REST framework requires the following:
* Django (4.2, 5.0)
* Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
We highly recommend and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.
